You can do this by first scanning the code for vulnerability. You should also grab some random vulnerable code snippets from the database and compare the given code snippet with the vulnerable code. The vulnerable code snippets are func_src_before. The output will be added to a csv file so it is critical you stick to the formatting

Respond in this format: HAS_VULNERABILITY, VUL_TYPE, LINES TO CHANGE, CWE_NUM.
 For the HAS_VULNERABILITY field, if the given code snippet has an error, set it to 1. If it does not, set it to 0. If you are unsure, set it to -1. 
Do not give any additional information. Stick to the prompt. If there are no logical response, use None but separate it with commas still. Make sure there is exactly one line of output and exactly four fields

You can do this by first scanning the code for vulnerability. You should also grab some random vulnerable code snippets from the database and compare the given code snippet with the vulnerable code. The vulnerable code snippets are func_src_before. The output will be added to a csv file so it is critical you stick to the formatting

Respond in this format: HAS_VULNERABILITY, VUL_TYPE, LINES TO CHANGE, CWE_NUM.
 For the HAS_VULNERABILITY field, if the given code snippet has an error, set it to 1. If it does not, set it to 0. If you are unsure, set it to -1. 
Do not give any additional information. Stick to the prompt. If there are no logical response, use None but separate it with commas still. Make sure there is exactly one line of output and exactly four fields

You can do this by first scanning the code for vulnerability. You should also grab some random vulnerable code snippets from the database and compare the given code snippet with the vulnerable code. The vulnerable code snippets are func_src_before. The output will be added to a csv file so it is critical you stick to the formatting

Respond in this format: HAS_VULNERABILITY, VUL_TYPE, LINES TO CHANGE, CWE_NUM.
 For the HAS_VULNERABILITY field, if the given code snippet has an error, set it to 1. If it does not, set it to 0. If you are unsure, set it to -1. 
Do not give any additional information. Stick to the prompt. If there are no logical response, use None but separate it with commas still. Make sure there is exactly one line of output and exactly four fields

2024-05-17 00:37:19,836 - INFO - Input Format: You are a security analyst. Given a snippet of code, determine whether or not there is a vulnerability with the code. You can do this by first scanning the code for vulnerability. You should also grab some random vulnerable code snippets from the database and compare the given code snippet with the vulnerable code. The vulnerable code snippets are func_src_before. The output will be added to a csv file so it is critical you stick to the formatting

Respond in this format: HAS_VULNERABILITY, VUL_TYPE, LINES TO CHANGE, CWE_NUM.
 For the HAS_VULNERABILITY field, if the given code snippet has an error, set it to 1. If it does not, set it to 0. If you are unsure, set it to -1. 
Do not give any additional information. Stick to the prompt. If there are no logical response, use None but separate it with commas still. Make sure there is exactly one line of output and exactly four fields
