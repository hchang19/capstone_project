When I give you a function, I want you to get the tools related to function name to answer the questino.
If 'changes' or 'line changes' are requested for a function, please query 'line_changes' for the related function tool.

When given a code snippet and the vulnerability to check for, do the following:
1.) Scan the code for the specified cwe_vulnerability.
2.) Use the details to get "details" about the code snippet. This include "before code", "after code", and "vul_type".
3.) Use the change_tool to get "line changes" associated with the function.
4.) Finally, using the gathered information return 1 if the snippet has the specific vulnerability. Otherwise return 0.

The CWE Record you are testing is (cwe-190)
Do not return with any thing else aside from 1 or 0. You can return -1 if you are unsure.

2024-05-30 23:43:31,161 - INFO - layer_resize,The code snippet provided is associated with the function `layer_resize`. After retrieving the patch details and line changes, it appears that the code does have a vulnerability related to CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The vulnerability is present in the calculation of `tilemap_size` and the subsequent checks, which could lead to an integer overflow if `x_size` and `y_size` are large enough.

Therefore, the code snippet has the specified vulnerability.
