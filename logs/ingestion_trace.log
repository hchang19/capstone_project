=== Calling Function ===
Calling function: gps_tracker_changes_tool with args: {"input": "show changes"}
=== Function Output ===
The changes made to the function include:

**Deleted Line:**
- Line number: 89
- Characters from index 2379 to 2452
- Content: `if( recv( gpsd_sock, line + pos, sizeof( line ) - 1, 0 ) <= 0 )`

**Added Line:**
- Line number: 89
- Characters from index 2379 to 2458
- Content: `if( recv( gpsd_sock, line + pos, sizeof( line ) - pos - 1, 0 ) <= 0 )`
=== LLM Response ===
The changes made to the `gps_tracker` function in the vulnerability patch are as follows:

**Deleted Line:**
- Line number: 89
- Characters from index 2379 to 2452
- Content: `if( recv( gpsd_sock, line + pos, sizeof( line ) - 1, 0 ) <= 0 )`

**Added Line:**
- Line number: 89
- Characters from index 2379 to 2458
- Content: `if( recv( gpsd_sock, line + pos, sizeof( line ) - pos - 1, 0 ) <= 0 )`

This change adjusts the buffer size parameter in the `recv` function call to prevent buffer overflow by ensuring the size is correctly calculated based on the current position in the buffer (`pos`).
