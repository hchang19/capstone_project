user: For the given code snippet, check if you have any vulnerability patch associated with it. Get patch details and line changes and determine if the code has a vulnerability. Code: 
ZEND_API void ZEND_FASTCALL _zend_hash_init(HashTable *ht, uint32_t nSize, dtor_func_t pDestructor, zend_bool persistent ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC)
{
	GC_REFCOUNT(ht) = 1;
	GC_TYPE_INFO(ht) = IS_ARRAY;
	ht->u.flags = (persistent ? HASH_FLAG_PERSISTENT : 0) | HASH_FLAG_APPLY_PROTECTION | HASH_FLAG_STATIC_KEYS;
	ht->nTableSize = zend_hash_check_size(nSize);
	ht->nTableMask = HT_MIN_MASK;
	HT_SET_DATA_ADDR(ht, &uninitialized_bucket);
	ht->nNumUsed = 0;
	ht->nNumOfElements = 0;
	ht->nInternalPointer = HT_INVALID_IDX;
	ht->nNextFreeElement = 0;
	ht->pDestructor = pDestructor;
}assistant: Nonetool: The function name is "_zend_hash_init".tool: The function name is "_zend_hash_init".assistant: The tools have confirmed the function name "_zend_hash_init" but did not provide the necessary details about the vulnerability patch or line changes. I will attempt to retrieve the specific details again.

Let me try to get the details and line changes for the function "_zend_hash_init" to determine if the code snippet has the specified vulnerability.tool: The function name is "_zend_hash_init".tool: The function name is "_zend_hash_init".assistant: It appears there is an issue with retrieving the specific details and line changes for the function "_zend_hash_init". Without this information, I cannot accurately determine if the code snippet has the specified vulnerability (CWE-190).

Given the lack of detailed response from the tools, I must return -1 as I am unsure about the presence of the vulnerability in the provided code snippet. 

Return: -1
