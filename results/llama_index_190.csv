layer_resize,The code snippet provided is associated with the function `layer_resize`. After retrieving the patch details and line changes, it appears that the code does have a vulnerability related to CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The vulnerability is present in the calculation of `tilemap_size` and the subsequent checks, which could lead to an integer overflow if `x_size` and `y_size` are large enough.

Therefore, the code snippet has the specified vulnerability.
